//! In the order Kodi's InputStream Helper uses: a copy the user pointed at, a copy a browser on
//! the machine already has, then the one Sonora fetched from Google into its own store.
//!
//! Nothing here lists a directory. Every candidate is an exact path this module builds and then
//! stats, because a process that walks folders looking for libraries is what an antivirus
//! flags, and a browser records enough for the path to be built without looking. A
//! Chromium-family browser writes the folder it settled on into its own
//! `WidevineCdm/latest-component-updated-widevine-cdm`, which is also the only way to reach a
//! browser installed where no fixed path predicts: on NixOS the bundled module sits in the Nix
//! store rather than under `/opt`. A Firefox-family browser names its profiles in
//! `profiles.ini` and the version it unpacked in that profile's `prefs.js`. The one folder
//! Sonora reads is its own store, which it wrote itself.
