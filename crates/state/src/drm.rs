//! Nothing is looked for until the current provider is one whose tracks need the module, so a
//! Spotify or YouTube run never touches a browser folder. With none found, the user is asked
//! whether to download it from Google, shown Google's terms out of the downloaded archive, and
//! asked again before it is installed into Sonora's own store. A module accepted that way is
//! kept current without asking again. With nothing accepted, protected providers keep their
