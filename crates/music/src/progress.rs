//! How far a library scan has got, and whether it should still be running.
//!
//! A scan runs on worker threads with no channel back to the app, so the count lives in atomics
//! a reader can sample whenever it repaints. The same atomics carry the other direction: a scan
//! holds a generation, and anything that bumps the generation is telling the scan to stop, which
//! is what removing a folder mid-scan does. A second scan starting cancels the first for free.
